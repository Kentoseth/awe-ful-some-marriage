# awe-ful-some-marriage
The title of this repo is a play on the "awesome-lists" people create to highlight great products/services/etc. The inclusion of aweful is to highlight just how bad some of the marriage apps/websites can be.

The internet is a powerful enabler for many aspects of life that were previously limited to your known physical social-circle. If used properly, concepts like finding a spouse online would be a whole lot smoother and possible.

Unfortunately, as marriage is a fundamental aspect to Muslims for both physical and social reasons, exploitation of this need to make a profit is also possible.

The table below will display all the Muslim marriage websites ranked according to their results in the search engine DuckDuckGo.

Site | Deceptive<sup>*</sup> | Spam/Fake Profiles<sup>**</sup> | Owned by(Muslim/Non-Muslim) && jurisdiction<sup>***</sup> | Clicks to Pricing<sup>****</sup>
--- | --- | --- | --- | ---
https://www.arabiandate.com/ | No<sup>1</sup> | likely | SOL Networks Limited(Unknown), Malta | 2 <sup>1</sup>
https://www.singlemuslim.com/ | No | likely <sup>2.1</sup> |  Single Muslim Matrimonial services (Pvt Ltd)(Unknown), Pakistan/UK<sup>2.2</sup> | 4++ <sup>2.3</sup>

#### Notes

<sup>*</sup>A deceptive site is one that says it is free, but the only way to actually use the site properly is to pay

<sup>**</sup>The presence of spam/fake profiles is based on the combination of business-model, jurisdiction and level of transparency the site has concerning its pricing/ownership/operations. The rank is either/or: unlikely/likely

<sup>***</sup>Analyzing which company owns the website, are they visibly Muslim and what jurisdiction governs the entity. Jurisdiction is important for privacy-minded people

<sup>****</sup>A simple analysis for how many times you need to click to find the pricing page. The higher the clicks, the worse you can consider the site to be, as they purposely bury this information and induce you to signup

<sup>1</sup>ArabianDate doesn't actually have a visible pricing page and you have to navigate to their "About" page to find out more concerning how the system works. The site doesn't say it is free, but the "About" page is mind-boggling and they even have an FAQ titled "4. Why might members on arabiandate.com look more attractive than members on some other sites?"

<sup>2.1</sup>Relies on a freemium model where women get full access for free. The likelihood of fake women accounts increases

<sup>2.2</sup>This site raised some eyebrows. The only way to find out which entity owns the website is to check: https://www.singlemuslim.com/page/contactus and then too, it is unclear if the entity is Pakistani or British, as they have a British PO Box but a Pakistani postal address

<sup>2.2</sup>It took me 4 clicks to learn that a Gold membership exists and that there is some Â£10 per month offer, but the pricing page cannot be found
